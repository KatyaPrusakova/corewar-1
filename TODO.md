### To do for each instruction

1. Check the definition & requirements for instruction from subject & docs
2. Add those requirements as a comment
3. First implementation
4. Add descriptive prints for debugging purposes () and set them behind a verbosity flag
5. Write a test player that tests all combinations of arguments

### Tests

- unit tests for each instruction
- tests with single players: more complex combinations of instructions
- tests with multiple players
- tests for other required (+ bonus) features
