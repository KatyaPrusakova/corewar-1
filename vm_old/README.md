## The bytecode

The bytecode generated by the asm that will be passed to the VM consists of the following data:

The first 4 bytes represent the magic header defined as COREWAR_EXEC_MAGIC in asm.h.

The following PROG_NAME_LENGTH contains the program name. If the actual name is less than PROG_NAME_BYTES, the rest of the bytes are filled with zero bytes.

The next four bytes are NULL bytes.

The next four bytes represent the size of the executable instructions of our champion. The limit is defined in asm.h as CHAMP_MAX_SIZE

The following COMMENT_LENGTH bytes contain the comment of our program.

The comment is followed by four NULL bytes.

The following bytes are for the code to be executed. This is not padded with zeros.

Playeriin prog_size, prog name, comment, header

When __ is introduced, it produces the following code: 
"* Player 2, weighing 325 bytes, "Celebration Funebre v0.99pl42" ("Jour J") !"

Player player_number, weighing prog_size bytes, "prog_name" ("comment") !
